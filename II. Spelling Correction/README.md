The goal of this project is to build a spelling corrector based on the Levenshtein distance that meets the following requirements. 

Your spelling correction function:
* should accept a word and return the corrected word.
* may use only standard libraries and numpy.
* may use this English word list/frequency data.

Document some specific cases in which the Levenshtein-distance spelling corrector works well and in which it works poorly. Why is it working poorly and how could it be improved?
