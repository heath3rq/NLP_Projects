The goal of this project is to build a document classifier that meets the following requirements. 

Explore how term-document matrices and weightings can be used for document classification. You will be attempting to distinguish between documents from different categories in the Brown corpus. Use the provided script as a starting point. Before beginning, read and understand what itâ€™s doing. Then implement three sorts of document vectors:
1. Raw counts of terms in each document.
2. TF-IDF weighting, using the specific scheme described by Jurafsky and Martin (ch. 6).
3. Another weighting of your own invention/discovery. This may be another TF-IDF variant, or something else entirely!

You may use only built-in Python modules and numpy. You should turn in a document describing the third method that you used and discussing all of the results. The results/discussion should include a) the percent correct for each method, and b) a brief explanation of the relative performance, i.e. why does method A lead to better classification performance than method B?
